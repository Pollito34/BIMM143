# PDB Statistics

The PDB is the main datbase for structural information on biomolcules. Let's see what it contains

Download a CSV file from the PDB site (accessible from "Analyze" \> "PDB Statistics" \> "by Experimental Method and Molecular Type". Move this CSV file into your RStudio project and use it to answer the following questions:

```{r}
db<- read.csv("PDB.csv")
#db
```
```{r}
knitr::kable(db)
```


> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
xray.total <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","",db$X.ray) ) )
em.total <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","",db$EM) ) )
```

Turn this into a function to get the total of all the columns

```{r}
# x will be the input 
  sumcomma <- function(x) {
    #substitue the comma and convert to numberic 
    sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","",x) ) )
  }
```

For Xray:

```{r}
sumcomma(db$X.ray)/sumcomma(db$Total)
```

For EM:

```{r}
round(sumcomma(db$EM)/sumcomma(db$Total), 2)
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round( sumcomma(db$Total[1]) / sumcomma(db$Total) , 2)
```

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

SKIPPED

# Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

The structure is too low a resolution to see H atoms. You need a sub 1 Angstrom resolution to see Hydrogen.

> Q5: There is a critical "conserved" water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

HOH 308

# Working with structures in R

We can use the `bio3d` package to read and perform bioinformatics calculations on PDB structures.

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?

From the output above I can see: 198

> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues?

HOH (Water)

> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure?

2 chains (A and B)

# Predicting functional motions of a single structure

Read an ADK structure

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

Perform a prediction of flexibility with a technique called NMA (normal mode analysis).

```{r}
# Perform flexiblity prediction
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Write out a "movie" (a.k.a trajectory) of the motion for viewing in M01star.

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
